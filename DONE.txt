* [done 2011-04-14] Put config values into settings.py
* [done June 2011] Use new Peter's resolution table 
* [done June 2011] In submission loading, drop rows with no trait data (so that unused rows from Karen's template do not make it to master)
* [done June 2011] Start ignoring the Summary column (with an error message)
* [done June 2011] Save summarized spreadheets in 'results' rather than 'subm-reports'
* [done? expired?] After these, send new taxa_resolution report to Olaf

[2011-07 either partly done, or not as pressing]
* Nail down the spec for taxonomy resolution, with Karen and Peter
** Should we have, for each contributing authority, that any resolved Genus+species shows up as synonym (of that authority?)?
** If two authorities resolve a synonym exactly the same, is this success?  Which authority should be "credited"? 
** Protocol for handling taxa that we cannot resolve. 
** Any arrangements for maintaining resolution tables collected by Peter, as a resource? (internal or public)
*** Should this attempt resolution w.r.t. references as well? 
** Stability of headers in the files I receive from Peter
