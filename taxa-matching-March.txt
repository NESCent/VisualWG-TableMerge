[These are old rules, used in March 2011, for the Meeting 3 merge. 
At that time, submissions contained published genus+species, as well as optional "resolved" full taxonomy. 
For June, WG decided to provide full "published" taxonomy -- see the current taxa-matching.txt]

Taxonomy resolution for Visual WG
---------------------------------

We assume that a submission row always has a (pub-genus, pub-species) specified. 
(If they were not provided, but (subm-genus, subm-species) were, we copied the latter to the former.)

Some submissions may also contain resolved taxonomy.  
Denote those as subm-class, subm-order, subm-family, subm-genus, subm-species, subm-subspecies. 
(They are Class, ..., Species in the submission data - i.e., capitalized.)

Peter's taxonomy resolution table contains
auth-synonym, auth-class, auth-order, auth-family, auth-genus, auth-species, auth-sourceid
(They are class, ...., species in spreadsheets - i.e., lower case.)

In summary: 
We match the concatenation  (pub-genus + ' ' + pub-species) against auth-synonym in order to determine 
the authoritative (auth-class, auth-order, auth-family, auth-genus, auth-species). 
In cases of ambiguity, we try to resolve it using subm-family, if available.


For details, here is the table summarizing tests and actions constituting the 
matching of (pub-genus + ' ' + pub-species) against auth-synonym: 
(These also are the status columns showing up in the resolution reports.)


pub_match	fam_match	curr_agreement		taxon_action    data_action 
---------   ---------	--------------  	------------	-----------
notfound	n/a			n/a					notfound		ignore
exact		n/a			nocurr				writein			accept 
exact		n/a			agree				ok				accept
exact		n/a			disagree			override		accept        

ambig		nocurr		n/a					foundmany		ignore

ambig		notfound	n/a					foundmany		ignore
ambig		exact		nocurr				writein			accept
ambig		exact		agree				ok				accept
ambig		exact		disagree			override		accept
ambig		ambig		n/a					foundmany		ignore

Legend: 

notfound:  no match of (pub-genus + ' ' + pub-species) against auth-synonym, 
           or no match of subm-family against auth-family, as appropriate
           
exact: exactly one matching authority entry was found

ambig: 2 or more matching authority entries 

nocurr: no value was provided for subm-family or for (subm-class, subm-order, subm-family), as appropriate. 
agree:  subm-xxx was provided and agrees with auth-xxx
disagree: the opposite

ok:        subm-xxx will be accepted as is, since they matched the ones from auth-xxx
override:  subm-xxx will be replaced with those from auth-xxx
wtritein:  auth-xxx will be used, since subm-xxx were not provided

accept:  the data row will be placed in the merged spreadsheet
ignore:  the data row will be excluded from the merge
